Alexander Volkanovski:
Age: 36
Debut: UFC Featherweight Former Champion
He's been known for his toughness, fight IQ and well-rounded skill set.
In February 2024, defeated by Ilia Topuria, losing featherweight belt
Seeking to reclaim the title and re-establish his domination of the division.
His previous setbacks were mostly a knockout loss to Islam Makhachev in late 2023. In spite of these challenges, Volkanovski is one of the most experienced and hardest to kill fighters in the UFC’s featherweight division.
Diego Lopes:
Age: 30
So he is definitely a rising contender on a five fight win streak.
Note for hard-hitting striking and elite level grappling.
His most recent wins have come by way of unanimous decision against former title challenger Brian Ortega in September 2024.
Widely regarded as one of the most dangerous and versatile fighters at featherweight, Lopes was another matter entirely: This would be an interesting test of styles.
The victor of this matchup will not just take home the featherweight champion’s belt, they’ll also lay the groundwork for the future of the division. Volkanovski’s experience and previous title reign have some fans believing he is a favorite, while Lopes’ momentum and well-rounded skill set keep him a dangerous opponent.
